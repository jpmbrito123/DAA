# Group Project - Dados e Aprendizagem Automática


## Overview
This project consists of two main tasks involving the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to real-world datasets. In the first task, we predict solar energy generation using historical weather data. In the second, we participate in a Kaggle competition by building ML models to solve a data challenge proposed by the course.

Both tasks involve dataset exploration, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Objectives

- Apply key concepts of supervised learning.
- Evaluate and compare different ML models.
- Use Python and ML libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy) to build and train models.
- Understand data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
- Interpret and communicate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Task 1: Custom Dataset – Solar Energy Prediction

- Researched and selected a publicly available dataset related to solar energy production.
- Preprocessed and analyzed the data to identify relevant features.
- Trained and compared several models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R².

### Tools & Techniques
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for ML models
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization

## Task 2: Competition Dataset – Kaggle Challenge

- Participated in the Kaggle competition: [daasbstp2023](https://www.kaggle.com/c/daasbstp2023).
- Explored and cleaned the competition dataset.
- Built and fine-tuned several ML models to maximize predictive accuracy.
- Submitted results to Kaggle and tracked performance on the public leaderboard.

### Highlights
- Implemented cross-validation and grid search for model selection.
- Dealt with missing data, outliers, and feature scaling.
- Analyzed feature importance and model generalization.
